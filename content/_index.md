# Recursive Heuristics

Welcome to Recursive Heuristics, my blog about various things that interest me. Here you will find my thoughts and opinions
on various topics. I have organized them into major categories, these being Tutorials, Today-I-Learned, and Devlogs.

## Tutorials

Tutorial articles, as the name implies involves me attempting to explain how to do or make something. I explain how to do something
that may be niche but useful to the right audience.

## Today I learned

This category contains articles about things I have learned about or discovered that seem worthy of a share. In some ways, it is
like the tutorials, but in this case I am the one learning, and passing on that knowledge. Some of these articles can blend in with
the devlog articles, because the subjects may pop up during research process for development.

## Devlogs

Devlogs are journals of the process of developing something. The thing doesn't matter that much, but seeing as I am a developer, it will
focus on building software of various kinds and uses. I plan to share my wins and losses, struggles and triumphs as i build the next big thing. The devlogs are mostly to keep me sane during the process and also for me to look back and see how far I have come.
